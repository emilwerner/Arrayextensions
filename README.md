# Arrayextensions
This is a plugin that extends the functionality of the array type in JavaScript. Coming from a .NET background I often miss the use of LINQ for IEnumerables and because of that I decided to implement my own version of it for JavaScript. Features are implemented and updated when I have a need for them.


Implemented functions:

<ul>
	<li>None</li>
</ul>
